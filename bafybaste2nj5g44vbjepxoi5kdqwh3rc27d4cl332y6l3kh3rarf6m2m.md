The **Nile crocodile** (*Crocodylus niloticus*) is a large [crocodilian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crocodilia) native to [freshwater](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freshwater) habitats in [Africa](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Africa), where it is present in 26 countries. Due to its widespread occurrence and stable population trend, it has been listed as [Least Concern](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Least_Concern) on the [IUCN Red List](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IUCN_Red_List) since 1996.[[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nile_crocodile#cite_note-iucn-1) It is widely distributed throughout [sub-Saharan Africa](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sub-Saharan_Africa), occurring mostly in the central, eastern, and southern regions of the continent, and lives in different types of aquatic environments such as lakes, rivers, swamps, and [marshlands](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marshland).[[2]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nile_crocodile#cite_note-Status-2) Although capable of living in saline environments, this species is rarely found in saltwater, but occasionally inhabits deltas and brackish lakes. The range of this species once stretched northward throughout the Nile, as far north as the [Nile delta](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nile_delta). On average, the adult male Nile crocodile is between 3.5 and 5 m (11.5 and 16.4 ft) in length and weighs 225 to 750 kg (500 to 1,650 lb).[[3]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nile_crocodile#cite_note-Cott-3) [[4]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nile_crocodile#cite_note-Alexander,_G._2007-4) [[5]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nile_crocodile#cite_note-deBoer-5) However, specimens exceeding 6.1 m (20 ft) in length and weighing up to 1,089 kg (2,400 lb) have been recorded. It is the largest freshwater predator in Africa, and may be considered the second-largest [extant](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extant_taxon) [reptile](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reptile) in the world, after the [saltwater crocodile](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saltwater_crocodile) (*Crocodylus porosus*).[[6]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nile_crocodile#cite_note-Wood_1983-6) [[7]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nile_crocodile#cite_note-Guggisberg-7) [Sexual dimorphism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sexual_dimorphism) is prevalent, and females are usually about 30% smaller than males. They have thick, scaly, heavily armoured skin.   
Nile crocodiles are opportunistic [apex predators](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apex_predator); a very aggressive species of crocodile, they are capable of taking almost any animal within their range. They are [generalists](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generalist_and_specialist_species), taking a variety of prey.[[3]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nile_crocodile#cite_note-Cott-3) [[7]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nile_crocodile#cite_note-Guggisberg-7) Their diet consists mostly of different species of [fish](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fish), [reptiles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reptile), [birds](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bird), and [mammals](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mammal). They are [ambush predators](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ambush_predator) that can wait for hours, days, and even weeks for the suitable moment to attack. They are agile [predators](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Predator) and wait for the opportunity for a prey item to come well within attack range. Even swift prey are not immune to attack. Like other crocodiles, Nile crocodiles have an extremely powerful [bite](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bite) that is unique among all animals, and sharp, conical [teeth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Teeth) that sink into flesh, allowing for a grip that is almost impossible to loosen. They can apply high levels of force for extended periods of time, a great advantage for holding down large [prey](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prey) underwater to drown.[[7]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nile_crocodile#cite_note-Guggisberg-7)   
Nile crocodiles are relatively social crocodiles.[[8]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nile_crocodile#cite_note-Huchzermeyer-8) They share [basking](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Body_temperature) spots and large [food](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Food) sources, such as schools of fish and big carcasses. Their strict [hierarchy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hierarchy) is determined by size. Large, old males are at the top of this hierarchy and have primary access to food and the best basking spots. Crocodiles tend to respect this order; when it is infringed, the results are often violent and sometimes fatal.[[9]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nile_crocodile#cite_note-Garrick-9) Like most other reptiles, Nile crocodiles lay [eggs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Egg_(biology)); these are guarded by the females. The [hatchlings](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hatchling) are also protected for a period of time, but hunt by themselves and are not fed by the parents.[[3]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nile_crocodile#cite_note-Cott-3) [[10]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nile_crocodile#cite_note-Kofron-10) The Nile crocodile is one of the most dangerous species of crocodile and is responsible for hundreds of [human](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human) deaths every year.[[11]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nile_crocodile#cite_note-Sideleau-11) It is a rather common species of crocodile and is not endangered despite some regional declines or extinctions.
